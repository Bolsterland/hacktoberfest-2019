# Pursuing the ultimate dankness in life 
## by marcuswkl

My name is **marcuswkl**! I am currently pursuing a **PhD in Quantum Mememology and Meme Theory** in **Massachusetts Institute of Memes (MIM)**.

Ever since I started using Facebook, I've been scrolling millions of hours to browse memes.
Countless hours wasted on browsing memes has deeply impacted my life.
I started doing poorly in my studies.
I squeezed every possible meme reference in every conversation.
I began staying at home, distancing myself from society, just to browse memes.
Soon, I realised that my life has become a meme as well.

That's when I thought: "If my life is a meme, why not I make my life as dank as possible?"
Without hesitation, I signed up for A-Levels in Meme College.
I spent a whole year studying memes extremely hard and managed to score 4 A stars for Mememistry, Memesics, Memiology and Memethemathics.
After that, I enrolled in BSc in Mememology in Memes University.
With 3 years of advanced meme studies, I'm proud to say that I graduated with an overall average of 69.69%.

After spending 4 years of my life on studying memes, I still have that insatiable hunger of researching memes.
With that, I decided to pursue a PhD in Quantum Mememology and Meme Theory in Massachusetts Institute of Memes (MIM).
I hope that I can finish my meme research in a few years to finally achieve the ultimate dankness in my life.

>Memes are love, memes are life.
