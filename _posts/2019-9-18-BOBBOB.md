My name is BOB! I am a BOB here on how your BOB Profile should look like.

You can use an assortment of BOB formatting, just ask around and BOB will assist you ;)

For example, you can use codes with `\``,` so it'll show up as `BOB` rather than BOB

Or you can use block quotes with `>`, like this!
> Hello world!

Finally, here's an image of me!

Don't forget that you can check the source of this profile in the repo, as an example on what you can do in Markdown :D
